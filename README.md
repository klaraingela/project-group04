## Choice of framwork
For this project we chose to work with react. React is a well known framework that keeps growing more popular. The framwork is also often seen more throughout the job market, compared to Angular and Vue. React offers a getting started guide, which makes it ease to start up a project. We had not worked with any of the frameworks before. We chose React, due to its good status, but also because we saw it briefly in one lecture and grasped the logic quite quickly.[1]
